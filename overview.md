How are candidates chosen Graduate Student Member Perspective -- A summary?

Since I was on the graduate hiring committee, I wanted to add some insight into how the candidates were chosen.

A committee was formed:

There was a team of five faculty members and a graduate student who sat on the hiring committee. From my understanding, this committee changes for every new hiring. For the organism biologist search, the committee consisted of the following people:

Thomas Roberts (Chair)
David Rand 
Rebecca Kartzinel 
Jim Kellner 
Mark Johnson (MCB-- outside committee member)
Bianca Brown (graduate student member)


By the time I was asked to sit on the committee, the job ad was already formed and made public. I was merely told that we were hiring an “Organismal Biologist.” I am unsure of the procedure for any grad student to sit on the hiring committee—that is a question for the faculty members. 


Suggestion:
If the grad students would like more input on who sits on the hiring committee, we can ensure that the process is a more democratic one by doing any of the following:

1. Nominate a graduate student in charge of hiring on the department’s GSC 
2. Nominate a graduate student for each round of hiring. 

Since we all come with different expertise, I suggest option 2. 
I’m sure you all can think of various suggestions. 

The committee met three times:

Meeting 1: This meeting was held before the application period was closed.

We discussed what we were looking for in a candidate-- Fit. 
 
1.    We recently lost faculty members who had robust research programs in Phylogenetics and Plant Biology (Genetics, Phylogeny, Morphology, etc.). Naturally, we would want to fill these positions. However, there was a conversation about instead of trying to recreating what we had, moving towards making changes to the old structure.  
2.    Diversity. Diversity is at the top of everyone's list-- for a good reason. However, there are many kinds of diversity. For example, we have very few –young-- women faculty in the department. There are also very few racial minorities in the department across the board. There is also a diversity of thought. Also, there is always this question of commitment to diversity. Are we looking for a candidate to add diversity to the Faculty or a candidate who is committed to diversity? It is wildly exciting to think about how these two things differ. I’m always open to these discussions.
3.    The career stage of candidates. The hire was an open hire. That is, candidates at any stage of their career could apply once they held a Ph.D. How do you compare a post-doc to Tenure Track Faculty? In-depth conversations were had surrounding that. As you can see from the candidate pool, this is also something we will have to think about as we make our decisions about our respective favorite hires. 
4.    Can the department support the candidate research? As you know, we have three solid centers(hubs) in the department. Computer Biology (CCMB), Morphology (Morph Group), and Ecology (IBES). Should our candidates fit in one of those hubs, and if they did not, can we support their research. For example, if we had a candidate that works on human diseases, do we have the facilities at Brown to support their research. 
5.    Are we replicating what we already have? We were careful to invite candidates with distinct expertise than what is available-- This is obvious. 

After the first meeting we were able to come up with four categories to rank candidates:

Diversity 
Fit (see above)
Scholarship
Future Promise

There were ~210 applications. We followed the IBES model-- which was recommended by Brown's Office of Diversity and Inclusion-- and ranked the diversity statements first. 

How did we go about this? 

The 210 applications were split into three piles, and teams of 2 committee members were given a distinct batch. Each team had a unique set of applications. Each person from the respective teams read all the allocated applications from their batch. Each person ranked their candidates.

Meeting 2: The discussion of the diversity statements

Candidates diversity statements were average across the two members of each team. The ranks were sorted, and only candidates with top diversity statements went to the next round. We had 30 candidates that reached the second round. From my perspective, strong candidates tended to have strong diversity statements.

We all read the packages -- CVs, research statement, and teaching statement-- of those thirty candidates thoroughly and ranked each based on the Fit, Scholarship, and Future Promise. 

The general process of rankings 
We looked at publication records-- mostly first author record. For postdocs, we attempted to evaluate independence and future promise. For faculty members, we weighted grant success more heavily. 

Meeting  3: The choosing of our five candidates
We averaged across all six committee members and discussed each candidate. The top two candidates had a high score from all members. The other three took a lot of discussions. 

You can imagine some of the above conversations: 

1.    Someone has a strong scholarship—excellent publication record, multiple grants, but they aren’t a good fit for the department. 
2.    Researches with poor teach statements and mentorship record. 
3.    Strong candidates with lower tier diversity statements. 
4.    Candidates had similar research programs to faculty members.
